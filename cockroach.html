    Weeks 7 - 9
    PHYSICAL COMPUTING IN CLASS: These past 3 weeks have had a huge focus on physical computing. We learnt to do a few straightforward yet satisfying projects with Arduino. In our first lesson of physical computing, we were given a box filled with things I had either never seen before or things that looked somewhat familiar. 
    We were tasked with organising these objects and discovering both what they were named and what they can do. 
    Izzy and I worked together on the tasks- one was being able to turn on an LED light with a switch and the other was using a kind of sensor that reacted with the LED light turning on when you firmly pressed on the conductor.

PERSONAL PROJECT: I am working in a pair with Izzy for my final personal project. We intend to create an interactive quiz/survey that mimics and mocks personality tests and esoteric spirituality that is having a resurgence in this epoch of identity politics. We intend to infuse the survey with our own anxieties for the future regarding careers and personal purpose. We will do this with long winded questions and multiple-choice answers that don’t quite make sense or are surreal/humorous. 
We want to use p5 sketches, particularly webcam features to ask participants to “reflect on themselves”. 
We are currently in the process of creating a map of how this “choose your own adventure” will function.

  <p>
    HERE ARE SOME INSPO QUESTIONS/ WORDS/IMAGES ETC: 
-	Illuminati
-	Cult
-	Scientology 
-	Myers-Briggs
-	Personality Test 
-	Star Signs 
-	Humorous
-	Destiny/ Fate 
-	Uncertainty 
-	Desperation 
-	Loss of identity 
-	Existential 
-	P5s … webcam, scary sounds, sensory experience, “creepy but satirical” 
-	Choose your own adventure style… create a series of outcomes 
-	Outcome… escapism, surreal, stupid, each person is given a career-based outcome or some kind of “destiny”, some people may be asked to retake the quiz.
